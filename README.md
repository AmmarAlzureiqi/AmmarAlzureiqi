### 💻 Projects
Here are some of the things I've built that I'm proud of:
- **Hirestack**: A job aggregation platform that scrapes data from major job boards and uses **AWS serverless infrastructure** to provide insightful analytics on the job market. Built with Python, Django, and AWS Lambda.
- **Head Count**: An IoT-based **people counter** leveraging **computer vision** to help retail stores optimize space and staffing decisions. Implemented with Python, OpenCV, FastAPI, and Docker.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the code behind these projects and many more!

### 🌱 What I'm Learning
I'm currently exploring advanced **LLMs** and their application in business intelligence, including frameworks like **RAG** and **Agentic LLMs**. I'm also diving deeper into cloud-native solutions for AI deployment.
